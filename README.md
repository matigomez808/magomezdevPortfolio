Hello! This is my Portfolio project.

Im Matias Gomez, I'm a new dev based in Argentina.
I started learning to code a couple years ago with Python and then moved on to Java and Spring Boot.
Recently I finally decided to go about the FrontEnd route and taught myself some JS and React. Along came NextJS and a bunch of other frameworks.
Now I'm eager to start developing bigger things!
